  An outpatient (or out-patient) is a patient who is hospitalized for less than 24 hours.
  Even if the patient will not be formally admitted with a note as an outpatient, they
  are
  still registered, and the provider will usually give a note explaining the reason for
  the
  service, procedure, scan, or surgery, which should include the names and titles and IDs
  of the participating personnel, the patient's name and date of birth and ID and
  signature
  of informed consent, estimated pre- and post-service time for a history and exam
  (before
  and after), any anesthesia or medications needed, and estimated time of discharge
  absent
  any (further) complications. Treatment provided in this fashion is called ambulatory
  care. Sometimes surgery is performed without the need for a formal hospital admission
  or
  an overnight stay. This is called outpatient surgery. Outpatient surgery has many
  benefits, including reducing the amount of medication prescribed and using the
  physician's or surgeon's time more efficiently. More procedures are now being performed
  in a surgeon's office, termed office-based surgery, rather than in a hospital-based
  operating room. Outpatient surgery is suited best for healthy patients undergoing minor
  or intermediate procedures (limited urologic, ophthalmologic, or ear, nose, and throat
  procedures and procedures involving the extremities).

  An inpatient (or in-patient), on the other hand, is "admitted" to the hospital and
  stays
  overnight or for an indeterminate time, usually several days or weeks, though in some
  extreme cases, such as with coma or persistent vegetative state patients, stay in
  hospitals for years, sometimes until death. Treatment provided in this fashion is
  called
  inpatient care. The admission to the hospital involves the production of an admission
  note. The leaving of the hospital is officially termed discharge, and involves a
  corresponding discharge note.

  Misdiagnosis is the leading cause of medical error in outpatient facilities. Ever since
  the National Institute of Medicine’s groundbreaking 1999 report, “To Err is Human”,
  found
  up to 98,000 hospital patients die from preventable medical errors in the U.S. each
  year,
  government and private sector efforts have focused on inpatient safety.[1] While
  patient
  safety efforts have focused on inpatient hospital settings for more than a decade,
  medical errors are even more likely to happen in a doctor’s office or outpatient clinic
  or center.</p>
